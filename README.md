To use this plugin copy this folder "case" and paste it into the "plugins" folder in tinymce directory.

Here's an example on how to add the dropdown case-change button to your tinymce WYSIWYG editor when initializing it:

tinymce.init(
	{
		selector: "textarea#tinymceEditor",
		toolbar: ["case"],
            	plugins: ["case"],
	}
);

Simply include "case" in your tinymce toolbar's configuration as well as in the plugins' configuration.
